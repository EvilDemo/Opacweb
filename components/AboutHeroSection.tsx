              Formerly known as Vanta, OPAC marks the return of a long standing vision conceived in early years, now
              renewed with clarity, relevance, and intention.
              <br />
              <br />
              What began in 2021 as a university project soon evolved into a named and intentional musical endeavour.
              Over time, it expanded becoming broader, multidimensional, and future-facing.
              <br />
              <br /> Born from an emotional and spiritual void, it emerges with purpose. The name evokes depth, the
              acronym defines our mission. Black holds time and space, light reveals intent.
              <br />
              <br /> Today, OPAC is a cross disciplinary platform, where innovation and distinction drive every
              initiative. We exist to introduce new ideas, elevate creative freedom, and shape meaningful narratives.
              Branches connect. Purpose remains. Positioned as both a creative platform and an independent label, OPAC
              stands at the intersection of music, arts, and fashion - writing a new chapter in Portugalâ€™s contemporary
              cultural landscape.
